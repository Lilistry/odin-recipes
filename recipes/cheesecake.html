<p><h2><strong>Description</strong></h2></p>

<p>New York cheesecake is known for its creamy, satiny texture. 
   Itâ€™s rich, dense and tall with a flat top. Itâ€™s made with cream cheese, eggs, egg yolks and 
   heavy cream or sour cream to add richness and a smooth consistency. 
   Sometimes, itâ€™s flavored with lemon to add freshness.</p>
    
<p>The cheesecake is not baked in a water bath, but instead, 
   is baked at a high temperature for several minutes, and then 
   at a low temperature to ensure it stays creamy inside.</p>

   <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
   
   <h4>Crust</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker, 
        digestive biscuits, or vanilla wafer 
        crumbs (pulse in a food processor until finely ground)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>4 and 1/2 tablespoons (65g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Filling</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>4 cups (900g) full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 and 1/8 cups (225g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>4 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk , at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Grated lemon zest from 1 small lemon (1 teaspoon)</li>
   </ul>

   <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F/180Â°C. 
    Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan (bottom and sides) 
    with a large piece of foil.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together crumbs, sugar, and melted 
        butter and mix until combined and moistened. Press mixture 
        into the bottom of prepared pan to form an even layer of crumbs. 
        Bake for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Allow to cool 
        completely on a wire rack. Meanwhile, prepare the filling.</li>
    <li>Increase oven temperature to 425Â°F/220Â°C.</li> 
    <li>In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or 
        using a handheld mixer, beat cream cheese on medium-low speed 
        until smooth and lump-free, 1-2 minutes. Add sugar and beat 
        until blended. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as 
        necessary using a rubber spatula. Add cornstarch and mix until 
        blended. Add the eggs and beat until fully combined. Add cream, 
        vanilla extract, and lemon zest and beat just until combined 
        and smooth. Pour batter over cooled crust and spread evenly.</li>
    <li>Bake cake for 10 minutes, then lower temperature to 225Â°F/110Â°C 
        and continue to bake for 60 minutes until the sides are set but 
        the center is still slightly wobbly (some comments suggested 
        this was not enough baking time. I baked this so many times 
        and it works. If you're not sure if your oven temperature is 
        accurate or if your baking time is usually longer than those 
        called for in a recipe, you can add an additional 10-20 minutes, 
        and avoid opening the oven door too many times). My cheesecake 
        always gets golden brown around the edges but if yours doesn't, 
        that's ok, just trust the recipe ðŸ™‚ Turn off oven, open the oven 
        door slightly or halfway to let in cold air, and leave the cake 
        in the oven for 60 minutes. This will help prevent the cake from 
        cracking and the cake will remain creamy. Transfer the cake to a 
        wire rack and allow it to cool to room temperature. Cover the 
        cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for at least 
        12 hours.</li>
    <li>Cheesecake will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days</li>
