<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Soft and gooey, these brownies ooze chocolate</p>


<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and HOT</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil, (olive oil or coconut oil are fine)</li>
    <li>1 1/8 cup superfine sugar, (caster sugar or white granulated 
        sugar)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all purpose (or plain) flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)</li>
    <li>Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil 
        spray. Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set 
        aside.</li>
    <li>Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a 
        medium-sized bowl. Whisk well for about a minute. Add the 
        eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour 
        (another minute).</li>
    <li>Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry 
        ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined 
        (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of 
        your brownies).</li>
    <li>Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly. 
        (OPTIONAL: Top with chocolate chunks or chocolate chips.)</li>
    <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies 
        in the pan no longer jiggles and is just set to the touch 
        (the brownies will keep baking in the hot pan out of the oven). 
        If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty 
        for fudge-textured brownies.</li>
    <li>Remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing 
        into 16 brownies.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Optional Add Ins</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Crushed walnuts, peanuts, almonds, pecans, chocolate chips, 
        peanut butter chips, chocolate chunks, dried fruit (cranberries,
        raisins, etc)</li>
</ol>
