<h2>Description</h2>
<p>White chocolate is incorporated into the cake layers, the frosting, and 
    the drip for a stunning monochrome effect.</p>
<p>White chocolate is made from cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids. 
    It doesn’t contain any cocoa solids, which are found in milk and 
    dark chocolate varieties.</p>

<p>Cocoa butter is separated from the cocoa solids (cocoa nibs), which 
    are used to make milk & dark chocolate. The remaining cocoa butter 
    doesn’t have a ton of flavor on its own, so sugar and milk solids 
    are added to transform it into white chocolate.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<h4>White Chocolate Cake</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat milk and chocolate until melted and combined, 
        cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Grease and flour three 6" 
        cake rounds and line with parchment.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and 
        salt until well combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, 
        cream butter and sugar on med-high until pale and fluffy 
        (approx 3mins). Reduce speed and add eggs one at a time 
        fully incorporating after each addition. Add vanilla.</li>
    <li>Alternate adding flour mixture and milk mixture, beginning 
        and ending with flour (4 additions of flour and 3 of milk). 
        Fully incorporating after each addition.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 40mins or until a toothpick inserted into 
        the center comes out mostly clean.</li>
    <li>Place cakes on wire rack to cool for 10mins then turn out onto 
        wire rack and cool completely.</li>
</ol>

<h4>White Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place egg whites and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer, 
        whisk until combined.</li>
    <li>Place bowl over a pot with 1-2" of simmering water and stir 
        constantly with a whisk until the mixture is hot and no longer 
        grainy to the touch or reads 160F on a candy thermometer 
        (approx. 3mins)</li>
    <li>Place bowl on your stand mixer and whisk on med-high until 
        the meringue is stiff and cooled (the bowl is no longer warm 
        to the touch (approx. 5-10mins)).</li>
    <li>Switch to paddle attachment. Slowly add cubed butter and mix 
        until smooth</li>
    <li>Add melted, cooled white chocolate and whip until smooth.</li>
</ol>

<h4>White Chocolate Ganache</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place chopped chocolate and cream in a microwave safe bowl. 
        Microwave in 5-10 second increments, stirring in between, until 
        smooth and combined. Add a few drops of bright white color gel 
        to get the desired color. Set aside to thicken and cool 
        completely.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Assembly</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place one layer of cake on a cake stand or serving plate. 
        Top with 1 cup of buttercream and spread evenly. Repeat with 
        remaining layers and crumb coat the cake. Chill for 20mins.</li>
    <li>Frost and smooth the sides with the remaining frosting. Use a 
        scalloped cake comb to create the textured effect on the sides. 
        Smooth the top. Chill for 30mins until frosting is cold and 
        firm.</li>
    <li>Using a small spoon, place dollops of ganache around the top 
        edges of the chilled cake, allowing some to drip down. 
        Fill in the top of the cake with more ganache and spread 
        evenly with an offset spatula. Chill to set ganache 
        (5 mins).</li>
    <li>Pipe dollops on top using an Ateco or Wilton 1M tip, top 
        each with a Lindt White Chocolate Truffle if desired. 
        Sprinkle chocolate shavings along the bottom and to fill 
        in the top.</li>
